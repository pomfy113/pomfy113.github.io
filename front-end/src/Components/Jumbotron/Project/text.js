      helped me build my front-end skills, having me go through multiple iterations of new tech

      I showed my 'Our Anime Chart' to a friend back in my old college, and he showed it to the owner
      of Anime Trending. Turns out, it needed some TLC; the database was written by hand, and
      their front-end needed some updating. I saw promise in the project and jumped on to help with
      their scripting, and the complete site redesign, no questions asked. I hope to see this project through,
      no matter the cost!`
